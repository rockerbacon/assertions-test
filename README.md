## Introduction

Test and benchmark libraries for the Assertions C++ Framework.

All documentation is available on the [ASSERTIONS WIKI](https://github.com/rockerbacon/assertions/wiki/Automated-Testing).

## Adding to Your Project

This framework is readily available when using the [Assertions C++ Template](https://github.com/rockerbacon/assertions-template). In case you're using the [Assertions C++ Project Manager](https://github.com/rockerbacon/assertions) but don't have this framework available, the recommended way to add it is with the command:

```
./dependencies.sh add git https://github.com/rockerbacon/assertions-test.git
```
